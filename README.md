# moltintools

This tool was designed after spending a stupid amount of time: creating, updating and deleting products from our [Moltin](https://moltin.com/) store.

## Getting Started

Right now this CLI tool is very simple and only takes two arguments command and file. Lets take a look at the example below:

`$ yarn run create file.csv`

As you can probably tell from the example above the file argument is a `.csv` file and this is currently the only supported file type.

The full list of commands are `create`, `update` and `delete`. You must specify command then file you will see errors.
